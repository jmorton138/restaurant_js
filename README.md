# Restaurant

## About this project

This is the Restaurant Project from the Odin Project's Full Stack Ruby on Rails Javascript Course. See full details here: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page

This goal of this project was to get some practice in using ES6 modules and webpack. The assignment specified that our html file would be essentially blank and all of our html elements would be created in our javascript modules. It was a good "taking the training wheels off" progression from the tutorials in the webpacker docs.
